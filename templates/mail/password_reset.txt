Hi,

SpkrBot again. Someone asked me to reset the password for your account. If this was you then please follow the link below to reset your password.

{{ protocol}}://{{ domain }}{% url 'django.contrib.auth.views.password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If you didn't request your password to be reset then someone might be trying to sign in to your account without your permission. If you think this is the case then please let me know by responding to this email.

Thank you,
SpkrBot @ SpkrBar.com
